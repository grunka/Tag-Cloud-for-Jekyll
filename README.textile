h1. Tag Cloud for Jekyll

h2. What is it?

It is a simple way to create a tag cloud for your "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/ generated site. By simple I mean that it is an include file for your site without the need for anything else.

h2. Why is this?

I started playing with "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com and wanted a way to display the classic tag cloud that many blogs like to have. From googling this it seemed like I would need a special rake files or plugins to make this happen. I didn't think any additions to the basic install should be necessary given Jekylls capabilites. This is the result.

h2. How to use it

# Put the tag_cloud.textile in your _include folder
# Include the file wherever you want your cloud e.g. p(#tag-cloud). {% include tag_cloud.textile %}

h2. TODO

* Handle the configuration of font sizes better
* Configure the links generated
